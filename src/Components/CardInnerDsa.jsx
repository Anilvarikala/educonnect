          <h1>Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>
          <p>
            Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental topics in
            computer science that form the backbone of problem-solving in
            programming. Learning DSA is crucial for students, particularly
            those preparing for competitive placement exams.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h2>Key Point </h2>
            DSA is not just a subject to ace exams but a lifelong skill for students aspiring to work in technology. By mastering DSA, students enhance their problem-solving abilities, boost their performance in competitive placement exams, and increase their employability prospects. With persistence and practice, DSA can help you become a skilled programmer, ready to tackle real-world challenges and succeed in coding competitions and interviews.
